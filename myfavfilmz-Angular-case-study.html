            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Myfavfilmz is a Full-Stack web application that <a href="https://github.com/dagrimb/myfavfilmz-Angular-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              I developed</a> using the MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) stack. It provides users (i.e., movie fans) with the ability 
              to register to create an account, find out info about movies, and create a list of their favorite movies.

            <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
            <p>
              This was the final project for my CareerFoundry Full-Stack Web Development program. I had previously 
              <a href="https://github.com/dagrimb/myfavfilmz-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built the server-side using 
              Node.js and Express.js for the API and Mongo for the database</a>. I had followed that up with 
              <a href="https://github.com/dagrimb/myfavfilmz-React-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating the 
              client-side using React.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              MyfavfilmzAngularClient was born out of the necessity to obtain some hands-on exposure to the Angular framework which, like 
              React, is a very popular JavaScript technology in today’s tech industry. I applied my knowledge of the topics that I learned the 
              course—such as data binding, interpolation, and templates—while developing this project. Another purpose of this project 
              was to give students like myself the opportunity to create detailed documentation that other developers working with the 
              project in the future could reference in order to know what my code does and how to work with it.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="objectives">
            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>
              The main objective of this project was for me to use my knowledge of how I had already developed a client-side for my REST API 
              and database with React and do the same thing with my new knowledge of the Angular framework. The problem that I was 
              trying to solve was two-fold: to enable movie enthusiasts to be able to access information about different movies, 
              directors, and genres whenever they want, and to show those viewing my portfolio that I could do so with multiple popular 
              frontend technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project was also heavily influenced by both of its ancillary, Agile project management and documentation elements. On the 
              project management side, I was to use user stories to <a href="https://trello.com/b/Hbz3fmvq/myfavfilmz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create a Kanban board</a> where I would not only manage the status (e.g., 
              “To-Do”, “In Progress,” or “Completed”) of implementing a solution to satisfy each user story, but also estimate how much time it 
              would take me to create each solution. The purpose of this was to gain exposure to this real-world, Agile method of teams using 
              this tool to plan their project sprint goals and timelines appropriately. This practice was paired well with the objective of 
              ensuring that my code was well-commented and well-documented so that my intent would be well-understood by not only my 
              hypothetical teammates, but anyone who wished to engage with my application in the future.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="tools">
            <h2>Tools, Skills & Methods</h2>
            <p>
              The Angular framework is the main technology focused on in this project—installing it and Angular Material and building the 
              components with the Angular CLI, using its router to allow users to shift between views, and making it responsive and creating 
              the dialogs with Angular Material. Angular is the main technological skill that this project demonstrates.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two softer skills are also focused on in this project—agile, project management methodology skills and collaborative skills. The 
              former consists of developing and applying user stories to create user flows and story points that inform the creation of a 
              Kanban board (which I used Trello for) and the latter consists of commenting on the codebase for the app and using TypeDoc to 
              generate documentation that is useful for anyone trying to understand the app.

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>
              I first took some time to familiarize myself with the project brief. I already had a pretty good idea what I wanted this project 
              to look like as I had recently created the client-side for the application using React. Next, I 
              <a href="files/myfavfilmz User Flows.pdf" download="download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">created a user flow with 
              Google Drawings</a>, trying to think of all the different behaviors and routes that users would experience and take while using my application. I looked at 
              both the user stories in the project brief and my user flow and assigned story points to different tasks which allowed me to 
              determine how much time each functionality would take to create. I then put my Trello Kanban board together, making note of these 
              estimations.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="approach-item-one"> 
            <p>
              One of the first files that I created was one to house the services logic for making API calls to the endpoints created 
              in my API (*1). 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="approach-img-one">

          </div>
          <div class="approach-item-two"> 
            <p>
              I then created component files for each view necessary to the user  and (in those components) functions that would use 
              each of those services to fetch or modify movie or user data (*2). 
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="approach-items-three-five"> 
            <p>
              In these components I also used the ngOnInit method (*3) to call these functions whenever the component loaded and 
              created dialogs and other methods that implemented Angular’s router to allow users to navigate between views 
              (*4-*5). 
            </p>
          </div>

                (*3) The ngOnInit method in the movie-card.component.ts file calls both the getMovies and getUserFavorites functions whenever
                the movie-card component loads

              <p>
                (*4) The backHome method, for example, uses the Angular router to navigate the user from their profile back to the 
                homepage when called in a click event

          </div>
          <div class="approach-item-six" id="localStorage"> 
            <p>
              I also made sure that the localStorage was cleared of the user info when the logoutUser and deleteAccountHolder functions 
              were executed (*6).
            </p>
            <div class="image">

            <p>
              I then created the HTML templates for each of these components, using the latter to pass data to the former. I gave the 
              registration, login, movie, and user dialog methods created in different  components the ability to be opened in a 
              corresponding template by adding click events to buttons and passed data to those dialogs when appropriate (*7-*8).

          <div class="approach-items-nine-eleven"> 
            <p>
              The templates were where I implemented a few different Angular directives. I used the ngModel to bind the 
              values inputted from the template for the user’s personal information (*9), the ngFor directive for displaying the user 
              and all of the movies (*10) in the general and user’s favorites collections, and the ngIf directive in icons to 
              display and determine whether a movie was a user’s favorites or not (*11). 
            </p>
          </div>

            <p>
              (*11) The ngIf directive in these icons is to check if the movie’s id was among the favorites in the list or not and whichever 
              condition was true, that icon would be active. So, if the movie was not in the list the icon would be uncolored and the 
              click event would activate the addUserFavorite function turning it blue; if the movie was in the list of favorites the icon 
              would be blue and the click event would activate the removeUserFavorite function turning it uncolored.

          <div class="approach-items-twelve-thirteen" id="final-approach"> 
            <p>
              Finally, I used interpolation to display movie, user and user favorite movie (*12-*13) properties in the appropriate 
              templates.

            <p>
              All-in-all it took me a little more than two months to get the application how I wanted it. This was with taking little breaks 
              here and there at times to work on other pressing projects.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              It was—for the most part—a fun challenge to complete this project. I really liked learning how Angular components worked with 
              templates to access and display information. 
            </p>
            <p>
              There were only a few minor hiccups along the way. The first was initially getting my registration and login API calls to work. 
              My user registration and login API calls would initially return the following errors, respectively: “Error Status code 0, Error 
              body is: [object ProgressEvent]” and “Error Status code 400, Error body is: [object Object].” I figured out the login issue 
              first: I had forgotten to add the = sign to the apiUrl path for the user login API call in my FetchAPIData service file. The 
              registration issue turned out to be the result of my MongoDB being inactive since I had not made new HTTP requests to it in a 
              while (this was resolved by logging into a Mongo instance through my terminal).
            </p>
            <p>
              The only other problem was that, for a while, I would get the following error for the getUser method in the FetchAPIData service: 
              “Error Status code 500, Error body is: Error: CastError: Cast to ObjectId failed for value (type string) at paid "_id" for model 
              "User"”. I resolved this by refactoring my project API params to take the username (and not the userID). This, in turn, lead to 
              me needing to refactor all API calls in my FetchAPIData service that referenced the userID, but this was a relatively easy fix 
              and resolved my issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m very happy with the product that I created. I don’t know if I would do anything differently in the future to get it where it 
              is at today, but I do hope to add some features (and maybe some more movies) in the near future.
